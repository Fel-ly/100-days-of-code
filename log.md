## Day 0: March 11, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about conditional statements, loops, and functions and continue statements in python.

__Thoughts__: I haven't coded in python before and had a real struggle not to include semicolons, but I feel like I'm getting a hold of it.
Grasping the content wasn't so difficult since the logic is the same as in other languages, so it's just the syntax tha is different.
