## Day 20: March 31, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Working on the 'balance' column. (the balance displays in the top-most row instead of the last oneðŸ˜…)

**Thoughts**: You know that moment when your code is working fine, then you try to improve it and now it doesn't even work anymore? Idk what I think about it but that is me right nowðŸ˜…ðŸ’”
